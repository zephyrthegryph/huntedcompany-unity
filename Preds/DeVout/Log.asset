  displayText: 'Noven are an elusive alien species with a biology composed of energy
    in the form of a crystal powder. They have no internal organs beside their stomach,
    which they use to sap energy from their prey, carrying their prey in their stomachs
    as a kind of biological battery. In Noven culture, eating others alive is seen
    as both recreation and affection.


    Novens are highly intelligent predators,
    known to purpousfully intimidate and seperate their prey using a variety of lures
    or scare tactics. As hunting is considered recreational, they don''t immediately
    attack and are known to intentionally try to outsmart and outmaneuver their prey
    before eating them.
